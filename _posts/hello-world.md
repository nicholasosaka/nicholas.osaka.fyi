It's how I start most projects: using this phrase as a place holder. It's also how I'll start this one. I'm going to be writing over the next few months on _things_ that I find interesting or engaging. I don't really know how else to describe that “thing”, since it's going to range from short pieces on cultural phenomena I've wanted to think about or something a little more technical, like an interesting bug and how it needed to be fixed.

For this post however, I wanted to describe this website. It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project hosted using [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Styling comes from the wonderful [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). I'm writing all posts in markdown, so I use [remark](https://remark.js.org/) to convert the raw markdown into React components for Next.js.

For now, I won't have tags on posts. I would rather not box in the subject matter, since I intend to write pieces that cross between philosophy and computer science. That's all for now; I'll talk to you soon.
